## Contents

* `CSP_Solver.py`: Python script utilizing the `python-constraint` library to model and solve the CSP for professor-course assignments.
* `ConstraintGraph.py`: Python script for constructing a constraint graph related to the CSP.

## Course Information

**Course:** CPSC 481-05 - Artificial Intelligence
**Instructor:** Professor Kenytt Avery
**University:** California State University Fullerton
**Exercise:** Exercise 4 - Fall 2023

## Problem Description

Consider the problem of assigning professors to teach courses in a computer science department. The constraints and preferences for this problem are as follows:

* Professor A can teach CPSC 101 and CPSC 103.
* Professor B can teach CPSC 101, CPSC 102, and CPSC 104.
* Professor C can teach CPSC 102 and CPSC 103.
* CPSC 101 and CPSC 104 are scheduled for 7:00 pm on Mondays.
* CPSC 102 and CPSC 103 are scheduled for 9:00 pm on Wednesdays.
* Professor A does not want to teach CPSC 103 this semester.
* The department plans to offer at least one class to each professor.

# About Constraint Satisfaction Problems (CSP)

## What is CSP?

Constraint Satisfaction Problems (CSP) are a key concept in artificial intelligence for solving problems with constraints. CSPs involve assigning values to variables while adhering to specified constraints.

## Components:

1. **Variables:** Entities to which values are assigned (e.g., professors, days).
2. **Domains:** Sets of values variables can take.
3. **Constraints:** Rules limiting variable combinations.

## Solving CSPs:

Solving a CSP entails finding consistent variable assignments that meet all constraints. Algorithms like backtracking are commonly used.

## Real-World Applications:

CSPs find use in scheduling, configuration, puzzle-solving, and more, providing a structured approach to complex problems.

## Why Learn CSP?

Understanding CSPs is vital for AI, operations research, and computer science. It enhances problem-solving skills and offers insights into decision-making processes.

Explore the scripts in this repository to see CSPs in action and deepen your problem-solving capabilities.

## Questions and Answers For Problem
